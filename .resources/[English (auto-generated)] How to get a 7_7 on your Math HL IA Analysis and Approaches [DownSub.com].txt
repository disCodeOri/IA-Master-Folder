not the blue light darn it

hello my name

I am an incoming freshman at the

University of Chicago studying

biochemistry I did the IB in my high

school in Spain

I had no idea where to start when I was

writing my math I I didn't know what a

mathematical exploration was I was so

confused I needed help despite hitting

absolute Rock Bottom while drafting my

math eye

[Music]

I'm so proud of the end result and

hopefully this can be some sort of like

source of inspiration even if you don't

know what you're doing you'll make it

the math I seems very intimidating but

you can do it so while breaking down the

process of writing the math I I'll

always refer to the five criteria and

kind of show you how you can embed them

throughout your IA the five criteria are

a mathematical communication B

presentation C personal engagement D

reflection and e-use of mathematics

something to keep in the back of your

mind while choosing an IA topic is that

you need to essentially reach a specific

number you're answering a question and

the answer to that question should be a

number whether that be an area a

probability it could be a function an

equation but you need to have an answer

in your IA so make sure you're familiar

with the topic and that the math is

taught within the curriculum because if

you don't understand it you won't be

able to reach this number and your eye

will not have a conclusion what people

usually do and what I certainly did

initially is look up best math High

topics on Google usually the top results

are things that are quite overused I've

seen many examples of people optimizing

the area of food packaging and finding

the ratio between music notes and of

course these aren't bad ideas they're

really good ideas but it's important to

give them your own personal twist the IB

doesn't really grade you on originality

but they do grade you on how much you're

engaged in the topic and how much you

make it your own I know someone that did

volume of Revolution and I also saw this

on a video which I will link down below

but basically you can take an object and

outline it on Desmos and you'll have

different functions and you can

integrate the functions to find volume

of evolution Revolution not Evolution

ultimately if you end up using an idea

like this one that has been used before

just make sure to personalize it and you

can for example look up other real world

applications that use this mathematical

method and then jump from there it's

also important to consider Criterion e

use of mathematics when choosing a topic

because you're graded on whether your

IAS commensurate with the course which

means that it has to be HL and it has to

cover one of the five Topics in the

syllabus so I would avoid choosing a

topic such as statistics because this

specific unit doesn't have an HL

component to it in analysis and

approaches disclaimer it's obviously not

prohibited to do a stats topic just make

sure that you explore new and unfamiliar

math that's at a high level I was saying

this because the curriculum and Analysis

and approaches doesn't dive too deep

into stats like other math courses in

the IB I think there are two good

General ways of picking the topic the

first one is going from a general

interest my teacher made us do mind maps

with like different hobbies and

interests that you have and see how they

can connect to math this is the Mind map

that I made wow

one thing that kind of stood out to me

that I think is kind of a good idea I do

not know if this has been used or not or

one of my interests was dance and I put

plotting a stage Direction on the

Cartesian plane I think that's pretty

cool I didn't really use this that much

but I think some people it may be

helpful the second way to choose a topic

is by looking at the word problems in

your textbook this is what I did I have

the Pearson textbook and this is quite

effective because word problems show you

how the math that you're learning in

your class can be used in real life I

remember that I saw a word problem that

was related to like the concentration of

medicine in a patient's bloodstream from

there I looked up on Google how to model

the concentration of a drug in a

person's bloodstream and I found a

differential equation I could solve so

if you find a word problem that has an

interesting application research on

Google and see what you can find

so this is my advice take it with a

grain of salt but I highly recommend

investigating a topic related to

differential equations because not only

is it an atrial topic which will give

you those points for Criterion e it's

also a topic that has several real life

applications and even if you haven't

learned feqs yet in class with a bit of

background and integration you could

probably learn it in a couple of days

but you only really need to know first

order homogeneous and separable

difficues I think it's worth taking a

little bit of time learning how to solve

them because there are so many different

applications my textbook and my teachers

slideshows had several word problems

related to differential equations that

basically give you potential math IA

ideas many people have used Newton's law

of cooling but other applications of

differential equations include

predicting chemical reaction rates or

modeling the current in an electric

circuit one word problem that I thought

was quite interesting was related to

water leaking from a tank if you use

something like this you can see how you

can minimize the time it takes for water

to drain from the tank by changing

different dimensions that's a potential

idea I think there's something

called Bernoulli's equation

Bernoulli well I'll link a video down

below but there's a lot you can do with

calculating the rate of water flow

another word problem was related to

logistic growth and you can use that to

predict the increase of a certain

population and its carrying capacity

when you solve a differential equation

you're solving for a function that

models something so I highly recommend

it simply because you're going to have a

very focused research question and a

clear purpose in your ID in your i8

quickly I solved a differential equation

that includes the rate of change of

concentration of a drug in the

bloodstream in terms of time and you

solve for the function of concentration

versus time and the differential

equation has several different constants

and that's because the differential

equation works for different drugs but

you can evaluate the constants for

specific numbers that are unique to a

drug so for example there are constants

such as bioavailability volume dosage

and I plugged in the values for

Amoxicillin which is an antibiotic I

plug the values specific to Amoxicillin

into the function and that gave me the

graph for concentration versus time and

the importance of this is that you can

see whether the concentration surpasses

a certain limit of toxicity

depending on the dosage that you plugged

in to the function in the end I found

the area under the curve because that

gives you something called the

distribution of the drug or the exposure

to the body every drug has a certain

distribution number that cannot be

passed because if not it would be

considered toxic so by finding the area

under the curve for Amoxicillin I could

see whether the dosage I plugged in was

safe or not

your introduction consists of the

rationale you talk about the relevance

of your topic and you give an overview

of the whole investigation and this is

crucial for communication because you're

introducing your topic you can't get too

technical it can't be too complicated

it's important that your introduction is

concise so that your examiner isn't lost

already at the beginning many people try

to knock down the personal engagement

marks in the introduction by writing the

significant meaning that this topic has

in their life and obviously it's

important to explain why you chose this

topic and why it's important to you but

that shouldn't be your whole

introduction you should make it a couple

of sentences I think I did three to four

sentences talking about why I found this

topic interesting really what they want

to see is the relevance personal

engagement is more about your ability to

problem solve rather than the personal

connection that you have to this topic

if you explain Concepts through diagrams

Arts models or tables you're showing

personal engagement

this is extremely important for

presentation because it says here in the

rubric that you need to Define key terms

you may have to explain some Concepts

that are not related to math just so

that your examiner gets a little bit

more context to your investigation but

you have to be very careful with this in

my first math I.E draft I was very

descriptive with the biological

processes behind why the equation works

in the first draft I said during

elimination there are two main processes

that remove the drug from the

bloodstream which causes a decrease in

the concentration the first process is

metabolism which is when the drug

crosses the membranes of cells this is

not necessary yes I need to explain two

very important Concepts and terms in my

math I which are absorption and

elimination because I want to show how

the graph of concentration at first

there's an increase which is when the

drug is being absorbed into the

bloodstream and then decrease which is

when it's being eliminated from the

bloodstream but you have to explain the

mathematical interpretation you can't go

into depth on why this happens I start

explaining that this is because of

metabolism that's not necessary and

that's very important to keep in mind if

you're doing a math eye that's related

to a natural science if it's related to

econ if it's related to literally any

other discipline you have to make sure

that you focus on the math you cannot be

very technical in the terms well I

recommend doing in your background

information is include a table which by

the way tables do not need to be double

spaced the whole eye has to be double

spaced except tables which I was not

aware of so

my table is double spaced which is quite

painful I remember being frustrated

about that because it has to be 20 pages

and I went over the page limit at first

I included a table to Define all my

terms and I think this is quite helpful

for the examiner to refer back to in

case they forget what a certain variable

or constant means my very first table

and investigation includes key terms I

explain where they come from for example

absorption is related to the half-life

of a drug same with elimination I made

sure to include the units for each

constant variable and in my background I

explain very concisely what absorption

and elimination are without being too

technical with the biological terms keep

in mind that this is a math I and do not

start ranting on all the biological

physical chemical mechanisms that are

occurring because that's not the point

you need to contextualize your eye and

the background formation but the bulk of

your IA is going to be your mathematical

method your your calculation and all of

that stuff so don't take up too much

space

explaining all your terms

so now on to the cream of the Oreo after

your background is the most important

part of your IA which is your

investigation you are explaining the

method that you're using you're

explaining all your calculations I

basically divide my investigation to

several parts I start by explaining the

differential equation and how the terms

are related to each other so throughout

the investigation part of it I have

several different titles that explain

each step of solving the differential

equation throughout my I included tables

to demonstrate the standard form of a

certain process and then the way that

I'm applying this method to the equation

that I'm solving in total I have like 11

tables and that really helped me

communicate what I'm doing as I solve

the equation underneath each table I

talk about why I'm doing what I'm doing

which is the most important part you

have to not just show what you're doing

you have to explain it and for example

in the first step I say that I'm putting

this equation into standard form because

that makes one side of the equation look

similar to the result of a product rule

when differentiating so as you can see I

always use the standard formula and how

I'm applying this formula to my

investigation you have to be very clear

with the steps you cannot really skip

any steps when you're doing your math

height I do want to reiterate the fact

that even simple calculations should be

included things that you would think the

examiner should know you still have to

explain why you're doing them in your

math eye which is kind of frustrating in

the first draft of my teacher circled so

many things and put so many question

marks

[Music]

it's very important in terms of

communication to show exactly what

you're doing and why you're doing even

if it is the most simple thing in your

eye so for example my teacher circled

the exponent of the integrating factor

and she just circled and put why when I

integrated it it was literally a simple

integration problem and I was really

confused I was like this woman knows

this she should know this but I still

explain that and finally I take the

values of amoxicillin and I plug them

into the solution of the differential

equation and I graphed the specific

function that I got my final step in the

investigation was finding the area under

the curve and something that I did was

use two different methods one of them

being the trapezoid rule which is when

you divide the graph into trapezoids and

add the areas of the trapezoids and you

do this by using discrete values of the

function and then I use integration to

find the area under the curve and I

explain why you would use both methods

at the end I found the distribution and

saw that it was below the level of

distribution that would be considered

toxic so I concluded that the dosage

that I had plugged in to the

differential equation was safe

and something that's really important is

reflection throughout your IA reflection

isn't something that you only talk about

in the conclusion a lot of people

include the bulk of their reflection and

the conclusion and reflection should be

demonstrated throughout the paper you

can show reflection throughout your

investigation by explaining your

reasoning and why you would do something

that's showing that you're reflecting

and if you make a correction or decide

to use an alternative method that also

shows reflection it's very important for

presentation to use the right notation

using math type is really helpful I

don't really like Google Docs embedded

software with like notation because it's

missing quite a few things and it

doesn't look as neat as math type you

can add it as an extension I think to

both Google Docs and to word and

throughout your investigation just make

sure to include many graphs that you can

create on Desmos

in your conclusion you summarize your

eye you summarize your results I talk

about the percentage error I compare the

theoretical value of the distribution of

amoxicillin versus the value that I got

in my graph you talk about the accuracy

of your model and you also interpret the

model or the results that you found and

one thing I did was find the maximum

point on the graph and I talked about

how at this point the rate of absorption

is equal to the rate of elimination I

talk about at what time this occurs and

what the concentration is is

at this point in the graphic so after

analyzing my results I included my

evaluation and extensions and in this

part you should be showing a lot of

reflection you should be talking about

errors and you should be talking about

what you can do to fix those errors a

possible extension to this investigation

is making dosage a function instead of a

constant because amoxicillin is not

always taken in a tablet or in a capsule

if it's taken in a tablet or a capsule

dosage is constant because it's taken

all at once but if the drug is for

example taken through an intravenous

needle an IV that would mean that the

dosage is constantly changing over time

so I talk about how I could potentially

correct my differential equation to

mimic this real life situation I talk

about how I could for example use a

trigonometric function instead of a

constant and how this would lead me to

using a very similar method but instead

I would have to use integration by parts

and one of my steps and I also talk

about how this differential equation

could be used for other drugs and by

plugging in the constants and values for

other drugs I could compare the

concentration versus time function of

different drugs with different factors

for example solubility in your

conclusion you should be diving really

deep into what you can do to make your

method better and you can simply wrap up

your IA after this I basically conclude

by saying I can conclude that a dosage

of 250 milligrams is a healthy and safe

dosage of amoxicillin and that basically

is the answer to the aim I was talking

about initially you should show at the

end of your IA that the purpose was

fulfilled and that you met your goal by

using your mathematical model

well guys that's it for today's video if

you have any questions just comment down

below I hope this was somewhat helpful I

think that the Mass Eye it sounds like a

very daunting task it doesn't have to be

too complicated just make sure that you

come up with an idea ahead of time I

would say that the math I probably takes

approximately a week to complete you

know if you're working on it every day

for a couple of hours an hour or two you

can probably get it done I will make

sure to cite all the textbooks that I

referred to in this video and include

some links to videos that

very helpful anyway goodbye have a good

one
