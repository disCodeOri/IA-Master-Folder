# Project Handover: Swimming Stroke Analysis IA

## Project Overview
Student is developing an IB Mathematics AA HL Internal Assessment analyzing swimming stroke patterns using Fourier series analysis of multi-angle video recordings.

## Current Status
- First draft completed
- Project plan developed
- Initial technical approach defined
- No actual data processing or analysis started yet

## Key Documents
1. Initial IA draft (see above artifact)
2. Project plan including:
   - Four-phase implementation strategy
   - Timeline estimates
   - Technical requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Software Stack
1. **Kinovea**
   - Primary tool for motion tracking
   - Will be used for all video analysis
   - Chosen for sports analysis capabilities

2. **Python Libraries**
   - Manim: For mathematical visualizations
   - NumPy: For numerical computations
   - Additional libraries as needed for data processing

### Data Sources
- Three video angles available:
  * Underwater orthogonal view
  * Above-water side view
  * Above-water front view
  * Videos not yet processed or analyzed

## Mathematical Framework
1. **Fourier Series Analysis**
   - Primary mathematical tool
   - Will decompose stroke patterns into harmonic components
   - Student needs guidance on mathematical concepts

2. **Coordinate Transformations**
   - Required for multi-angle analysis
   - Student needs introduction to these concepts
   - Should be introduced gradually

## Current Challenges
1. Student's Mathematical Background:
   - Limited calculus knowledge
   - Basic trigonometry understanding
   - Needs step-by-step guidance

2. Technical Implementation:
   - No prior experience with Kinovea
   - No prior experience with Manim
   - Needs software setup guidance

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up Kinovea
   - Begin video processing
   - Start learning basic Fourier concepts

2. **Medium Term**
   - Develop data processing pipeline
   - Create initial visualizations
   - Begin mathematical analysis

3. **Long Term**
   - Complete full analysis
   - Create final visualizations
   - Write comprehensive report

## Project Requirements
- Must meet IB Mathematics AA HL IA criteria
- 12-20 pages in length
- Show personal engagement
- Demonstrate mathematical rigor
- Include proper citations

## Communication History
- Student has expressed interest in complex approaches
- Prefers comprehensive but gradual learning
- Wants to maintain ambitious scope while building understanding

## Special Notes
- Student is motivated to tackle complex concepts
- Needs mathematical concepts introduced progressively
- Wants to focus on visualization and practical applications
- Prefers Kinovea over other motion tracking options
- Specifically requested Manim for visualizations
